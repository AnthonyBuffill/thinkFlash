 **Acceptance Criteria**

 - When I load the app I am greeted with a landing page naming the site, with a simple catch phrase, and a nav bar home to a `dashboard` button, a a `signup` button
 and an `about` button 
 - If I click the dashboard button I am taken to a page that can potentially house prior flashcard deck builds, a nav also with a `login` and `signup` button and a `create new` button in the body of the page towards the top left-hand side
 -Should I choose to `create new`, I will be presented with a series of questions pertaining to the subject matter and size of the flashcard deck I wish to build
 - If I follow those steps through a build I will be able to toggle through the newly creaated deck like any other user but if I wish to `save` the deck, or `edit` the deck, I will be told I need to `login` or `signup` to access those features. That is as far as an not-logged in individual may proceed.
 - Once a user chooses to either login with confirmed credentials, or signup by creating a user profile, they will then have access to the save deck feature which will allow them to render the deck to their personal dashboard to access anytime they like
 - Furthermore they will have the option to edit their decks by selection individual flashcards they with to alter or delete
 - Once a user wishes to use their deck either directly from the create deck feature or by choosing from a saved deck on their dashboard a pop out window will show the deck as well as some options for interacting
 - There, a user can click on a card to flip it to the opposing side presenting the answer to the question, click a "next" arrow to move on to another card, or choose to abort the deck and head back to the dashboard.
