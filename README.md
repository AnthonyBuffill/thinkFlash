## INTRODUCTION

Are you studying from an important exam?  Perhaps you have an interview and want to test your knowledge of the expected questions from a potential employerer?

You know the type questions on one side and answers on the flip side.  This is a technique for studying that has been employed for generations upon generations but the problem is when you write those cards you already kinda know the answers and the other is you ACTUALLY have to write those cards.

 ## Navigation

 - When a user loads the application on their device, they are greeted with a landing page naming the site, with a simple catch phrase, and a nav bar home to a `dashboard` button, along with a `login`, `signup` and an `about` button.
 # 
 - Once an existing user logs in or a new user signs up, they are redirected to  the `dashboard` page that can potentially house prior flashcard deck builds, also the navbar remains with a `login` and `signup` button and a `create new` button in the body of the page towards the top right-hand side.
 #
 - Should one choose to `create new`, they will be presented with a series of questions pertaining to the subject matter and size of the flashcard deck I wish to build
 *If I follow those steps through a build I will be able to toggle through the newly created deck and if I wish to `save` the deck, or `edit` the deck, I will have access to such features. That is as far as an not-logged in individual may proceed.*
 *Furthermore they will have the option to edit their decks by selecting individual flashcards they wish to alter or delete.*
 #
 - Once a user wishes to use their deck either directly from the create deck feature or by choosing from a saved deck on their dashboard a pop out window will show the deck as well as some options for interacting.
 - There, a user can click on a card to flip it to the opposing side presenting the answer to the question, click a "next" arrow to move on to another card, or choose to abort the deck and head back to the dashboard.
