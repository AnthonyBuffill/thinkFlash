You know the type questions on one side and answers on the flip side.

 ## Navigation

 - When a user loads the application on their device, they are greeted with a landing page naming the site, with a simple catch phrase, and a nav bar home to a `dashboard` button, along with a `login`, `signup` and an `about` button.
 # 
 - Once an existing user logs in or a new user signs up, they are redirected to  the `dashboard` page that can potentially house prior flashcard deck builds, also the navbar remains with a `login` and `signup` button and a `create new` button in the body of the page towards the top right-hand side.
 #
 - Should one choose to `create new`, they will be presented with a series of questions pertaining to the subject matter and size of the flashcard deck I wish to build
 *If I follow those steps through a build I will be able to toggle through the newly created deck and if I wish to `save` the deck, or `edit` the deck, I will have access to such features. That is as far as an not-logged in individual may proceed.*
 *Furthermore they will have the option to edit their decks by selecting individual flashcards they wish to alter or delete.*
 #
 - Once a user wishes to use their deck either directly from the create deck feature or by choosing from a saved deck on their dashboard a pop out window will show the deck as well as some options for interacting.
 - There, a user can click on a card to flip it to the opposing side presenting the answer to the question, click a "next" arrow to move on to another card, or choose to abort the deck and head back to the dashboard.
